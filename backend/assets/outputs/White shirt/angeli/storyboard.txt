She's wearing a comfy robe or oversized tee and has slightly messy (but still cute!) hair. Soft, natural light is coming from a nearby window.Character Expression: Playfully exasperated, like she's "dramatically" struggling with what to wear, but with a hint of amusement.Visual Effects: A quick zoom-in on her face as she makes the exasperated expression.**
2:**Description: A quick, dynamic transition (maybe a simple swipe effect). Angeli is now wearing the AGI Clothing white shirt, styled in a trendy, slightly oversized way (maybe tucked into high-waisted jeans or a skirt). She's fixing her hair in the mirror and checking out her reflection, applying a quick lip gloss. The camera angle is slightly higher, showing off the shirt's fit and details.Character Expression: Confident and playful. A slight smirk or a quick wink at the camera.Visual Effects: A subtle "glow up" filter or lighting effect appears very briefly to emphasize the transformation. A very short, quick-cut edit.**
3:**Description: Angeli is now fully ready, walking confidently down the street. Sheâ€™s accessorized the white shirt with stylish sunglasses and jewelry (optional). She gives a small wave to the camera as she walks. The background is a vibrant, aesthetically pleasing urban scene (coffee shop, colorful wall, etc.).Character Expression: Energetic and happy. A genuine smile and a confident stride.Visual Effects: Slight motion blur to emphasize her movement and create a sense of energy. Light flares add a trendy vibe.
